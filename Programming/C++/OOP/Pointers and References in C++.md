Pointers and references are two ways in C++ lets you work with an object ***indirectly*** - through its address instead of through a copy.

In everyday application code you can avoid them, but in ***games***, ***simulations*** and ***engines*** they are unavoidable: you use them to ***control memory***, ***avoid copy large objects every frame***, ***share state between systems***, and get runtime polymorphism for entry hierarchies.

This note builds up from the memory model, then covers ***pointers***, ***references***, ***const***, ***function params***, ***dynamic memory***, ***smart pointers***, ***polymorphism***, and finally concrete game/simulation patterns and pitfalls.

## Why this matters for games and simulations:
